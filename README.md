The goal of this tutorial is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great programmer is being able to solve your own problems. We’ll do that by exploring StackOverflow, Apple Documentation and learning how to search for solutions effectively. By learning to use these tools, you’ll be able to start adding custom features to an app and get it to do what you want it to.
